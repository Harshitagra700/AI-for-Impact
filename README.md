# Team Impacters: Fake News Detection Prototype

Welcome to the Team Impacters repository! üéâ

## Overview

In an age where information spreads like wildfire, distinguishing between real news and misinformation is more crucial than ever. Our prototype leverages advanced machine learning techniques to achieve an impressive accuracy rate of **99.28%** in detecting fake news!

## Key Features

- **High Accuracy**: Our model boasts a phenomenal accuracy of **99.28%**, making it reliable for practical applications.
- **Multi-Algorithm Approach**: We utilized three powerful algorithms to enhance the robustness of our solution, ensuring comprehensive coverage of various news patterns.
  
## Dataset

The model has been trained using the dataset available at [Kaggle - True and Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hruturajbabar/rue-and-fake-news). This rich dataset provides a solid foundation for training our algorithms, enabling them to learn and adapt effectively to the complexities of real-world news.
